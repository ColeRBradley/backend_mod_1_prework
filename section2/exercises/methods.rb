# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/methods.rb`

# Example: Write a method that when called will print your name:
def print_name(name)
  puts name + "!"
end

print_name("B-Rad")

# Write a method that takes a name as an argument and prints it:
def print_name(name)
  puts name + "!"
end

print_name("Cole Bradley")



# Write a method that takes in 2 numbers as arguments and prints
# their sum. Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in:
def add(a, b)
  puts "adding #{a} + #{b} to find my max age."
a + b
end

age = add(100, 100)


 puts "I am going to grow to be #{age} years old!"

# Write a method that takes in two strings as arguments and prints
# a concatenation of those two strings. Example: The arguments could be
# (man, woman) and the end result might output: "When Harry Met Sally".
# Then call your method three times with different arguments passed in.
def born_sex(male, female)
  puts " #{male} #{female}"
end

born_sex("I was born a man", "and born a women")

# What did you name each parameter, and why?
