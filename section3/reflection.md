## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * I love the talk about not comparing to others. I think that is such a big down fall of mine that I really need to work on. No one can be me and I cant be any one els. Everyone works at their own pace and as-long as you get the info it shouldn't matter if that other person got the info faster.
  * I also love the mind set of when you run into a stuck spot that you may struggle with not to give up and say I cant do this I am not meant for this. You have to look at it as an obstacle to over come and start to develope a plan to get unstuck. have some peace knowing that by getting over that stuck spot that you will grow and that you will only grow if you do not give up.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * I need a-lot of work in this category, I struggle with some things in my life that very few understand and I have always set it as a limitation on what I can do in my life. I look at others that don't suffer with my issues and compare my self to them. They have a healthy mind and i do not, they make that look easy and I do not. I am so pre wired to run on immediate gratification that it is hard for me to live in a growth mind set and build change over time.
  * I feel that on some level I have a growth mind set that is subconscious, because I have achieved some pretty great things in my life under great odds against me. You can say I have been forged in the fire.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
  * A hash is a way to store data in a list form. Each element of data is addressed by a name. It is different than an array because and array is a collection of things assigned to a number.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
`pet_store = {dog_cone: 20, dog_bone: 100, water_bowl: 50}`
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states["IA"]``
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`states.keys`
`states.values`
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
  * I would use a hash for notifications in an app. The hash would work better because notifications are a list of events that have occurred in your timeline with a key of the sender,name,reciever. And the value of each. Instead of a collection of elements.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  * With the level we are at with hashes I don't have any questions of note. Just when are we going to use them on a larger scale and see the true power of a hash?
